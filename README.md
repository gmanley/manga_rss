# MangaRSS

Some manga sites such as Bato don't have an RSS feed.
This app takes specific manga page and turns it into and RSS feed.

Currently this just supports bato.to but may support other sites in the future.

Take this title for example: https://bato.to/series/69569
RSS Feed: https://manga-rss.herokuapp.com/rss/bato/69569
